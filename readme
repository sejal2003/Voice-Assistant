This is a simple voice assistant project implemented in Python. It can recognize voice commands and perform various tasks like searching the web, telling joke and facts, playing video on youtube.
The voice assistant uses the 'speech_recognition' library to recognize spoken commands. It then processes these commands and perform the appropriate actions using python libraries. The 'pyttsx3' library is used for text-to speech syntheis, allowing the assistant to repond to the user.

To run the project you will need the following:
Python 3.x
'speech_recognition' library
'pyttsx3' library
'datetime' library
'randfacts' library
